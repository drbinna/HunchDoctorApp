@humeai/voice-react
Integrate Hume's Empathic Voice Interface in your React application

Overview
This package streamlines all of the required state management for building client side applications using the EVI Chat WebSocket through a <VoiceProvider> component and useVoice() hook. It provides a WebSocket, Microphone Interface, Audio Playback Queue, and Message History that are all designed to work closely together.

[!NOTE] This package uses Web APIs for microphone input and audio playback that are not compatible with React Native.

Prerequisites
[!IMPORTANT] This package is built for use within modern web based React applications using a bundler like Next.js, Webpack, or Vite

Before installing this package, please ensure your development environment meets the following requirement:

Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher).
To verify your Node.js version, run this command in your terminal:

node --version
If your Node.js version is below 18.0.0, update it to meet the requirement. For updating Node.js, visit Node.js' official site or use a version management tool like nvm for a more seamless upgrade process.

Installation
Add @humeai/voice-react to your project by running this command in your project directory:

npm install @humeai/voice-react
This will download and include the package in your project, making it ready for import and use within your React components.

import { VoiceProvider } from '@humeai/voice-react';
Usage
🚀 Visit our Next.js quickstart for step-by-step setup instructions and example code to jumpstart your development.

Context Provider
To use the SDK, wrap your components in the VoiceProvider, which will enable your components to access available voice methods. Here's a simple example to get you started:

import { VoiceProvider } from '@humeai/voice-react';

function Page() {
  return <VoiceProvider>{/* ... */}</VoiceProvider>;
}
Configuring VoiceProvider
See a complete list of props accepted by VoiceProvider below:

enableAudioWorklet?: boolean
(Optional) A flag to toggle the audio player implementation between AudioWorklet and AudioBuffer. AudioWorklet is recommended for best audio quality results on most browsers, but has degraded performance on Safari 17. Defaults to true.

onMessage?: (message: JsonMessage & { receivedAt: Date;}) => void
(Optional) Callback function to invoke upon receiving a message through the web socket.

onToolCall?: ToolCallHandler
(Optional) Callback function to invoke upon receiving a ToolCallMessage through the web socket. It will send the string returned as a the content of a ToolResponseMessage. This is where you should add logic that handles your custom tool calls.

onAudioReceived?: (message: AudioOutputMessage) => void
(Optional) Callback function to invoke when an audio output message is received from the websocket.

onAudioStart?: (clipId: string) => void
(Optional) Callback function to invoke when an audio clip from the assistant starts playing.

onAudioEnd?: (clipId: string) => void
(Optional) Callback function to invoke when an audio clip from the assistant stops playing.

onInterruption?: (clipId: string) => void
(Optional) Callback function to invoke when the assistant is interrupted.

onClose?: (event: CloseEvent) => void
(Optional) Callback function to invoke upon the web socket connection being closed.

clearMessagesOnDisconnect?: boolean
(Optional) Boolean which indicates whether you want to clear message history when the call ends.

messageHistoryLimit?: number
(Optional) Set the number of messages that you wish to keep over the course of the conversation. The default value is 100.

Connecting to EVI
After you have set up your voice provider, you will be able to access various properties and methods to use the voice in your application. In any component that is a child of VoiceProvider, access these methods by importing the useVoice custom hook.

For example, to include a button to start a call, you could create a button like this:

'use client';
import { useVoice } from '@humeai/voice-react';

export function StartCall({ accessToken }: { accessToken: string }) {
  const { connect } = useVoice();

  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          void connect({
            auth: { type: 'accessToken', value: accessToken },
            configId: '<YOUR_CONFIG_ID>',
            // other configuration props go here
          });
        }}
      >
        Start Call
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
[!IMPORTANT] Under the hood, the React SDK uses the AudioContext API, which must be initialized by a user gesture.

✅ CORRECT: call connect on a button click.

❌ INCORRECT: call connect in a useEffect to start a call on component mount.

Methods
connect: (options?: ConnectOptions) => Promise
Opens a socket connection to the voice API and initializes the microphone.

Parameter	Type	Description
options	ConnectOptions	Optional settings for the connection.
disconnect: () => void
Disconnect from the voice API and microphone.

clearMessages: () => void
Clear transcript messages from history.

mute: () => void
Mute the microphone

unmute: () => void
Unmute the microphone

muteAudio: () => void
Mute the assistant audio

unmuteAudio: () => void
Unmute the assistant audio

setVolume: (level: number) => void
Sets the playback volume for audio generated by the assistant. Input values are clamped between 0.0 (silent) and 1.0 (full volume).

sendSessionSettings: (message: SessionSettings) => void
Send new session settings to the assistant. This overrides any session settings that were passed as props to the VoiceProvider.

sendUserInput: (text: string) => void
Send a user input message.

sendAssistantInput: (text: string) => void
Send a text string for the assistant to read out loud.

sendToolMessage: (toolMessage: ToolResponse | ToolError) => void
Send a tool response or tool error message to the EVI backend.

pauseAssistant: () => void
Pauses responses from EVI. Chat history is still saved and sent after resuming.

resumeAssistant: () => void
Resumes responses from EVI. Chat history sent while paused will now be sent.

Properties
isMuted: boolean
Boolean that describes whether the microphone is muted.

isAudioMuted: boolean
Boolean that describes whether the assistant audio is muted.

volume: number
The current playback volume level for the assistant's voice, ranging from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (full volume). Defaults to 1.0.

isPlaying: boolean
Describes whether the assistant audio is currently playing.

isPaused: boolean
Boolean that describes whether the assistant is paused. When paused, the assistant will still be listening, but will not send a response until it is resumed.

fft: number[]
Audio FFT values for the assistant audio output.

micFft: number[]
Audio FFT values for microphone input.

messages: UserTranscriptMessage | AssistantTranscriptMessage | ConnectionMessage | UserInterruptionMessage | JSONErrorMessage
Message history of the current conversation.

To access interim messages, you can define a custom onMessage callback on your VoiceProvider.

lastVoiceMessage: AssistantTranscriptMessage | null

lastUserMessage: UserTranscriptMessage | null
The last transcript message received from the user.

readyState: VoiceReadyState

isError: boolean
If true, the voice is in an error state.

isAudioError: boolean
